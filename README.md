# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using PySpark & Machine Learning

A real-world machine learning project focused on predicting crop yields using distributed computing. Designed to assist farmers and agricultural analysts in making data-driven decisions for optimal farming practices.

---

## 📍 Problem Statement

Agricultural productivity varies due to multiple environmental and economic factors. This project aims to:

- 🎯 Predict crop yields based on input features such as area, production, rainfall, etc.
- 📊 Help optimize decision-making in crop selection and resource management.
- ⚙️ Use scalable tools like **PySpark** for handling large datasets.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- **Language:** Python
- **Frameworks:** PySpark, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy
- **Cloud:** Amazon S3 (connected via Hadoop configuration)
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn (for regression models)

---

## 🔁 Workflow Summary

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion & Setup
- Initialized **Apache Spark Session** using PySpark
- Connected to **Amazon S3** for scalable and remote data access

```python
spark_session = sql.SparkSession.builder.appName("HDFS").getOrCreate()
```

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used Seaborn & Matplotlib to visualize:
  - Crop type distribution
  - Yield vs Area correlations
  - Outlier detection & feature relationships

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Cleaned missing values
- Standardized feature scales
- Extracted meaningful features impacting yield

### 4️⃣ Model Development
- Applied **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree Regressor**
- Evaluated models using:
  - 📉 RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  - 🔁 R² Score
